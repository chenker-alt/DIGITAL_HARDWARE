# DIGITAL_HARDWARE
 Something about hardware but digital

### Description

This is an implementation of digital systems based on a material architecture.
You have to understand:
- the process (combinatorial,synchronous,and testbenches): sensitivity list, signal update
- description of state machine (in 2 processes: a synchronous for the state register, another describes the combinatorial logic)
- description of one or several registers ( with their combinatorial logic upstream) and/or counter(s) in a synchronous process
- description of decoding logic in a combinatorial process
- design-reuse: uses of generic parameters and types (natural, positive, integer)
